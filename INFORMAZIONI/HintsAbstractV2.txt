Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are the most massive and luminous galaxies located near the center of relaxed, virialized, and undisturbed galaxy clusters in the local Universe (Sandage et al. 1976; Lin et al. 2010). 

According with several observational studies (...Travascio et al. 2021) these objects experience special formation differing from galaxy evolution in general. Current theoretical models (e.g., De Lucia \& Blazoit 2007, Cooke et al. 2019) predict that the dry mergers are the dominant mechanisms responsible for their mass assembly.

Often, these object are observed to host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in their center (Rafferty et al. 2006).  
The process of matter accretion into these SMBHs may release a large amount of energy, resulting in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
There are two main modes in which SMBH accretion can occur: the so called “radio mode” and the “quasars mode”. 
The quasar mode consists in a high accretion rate of the SMBH via an optically-thick and geometrically-thin disk, and most of the energy is released in form of radiation. In a radio mode scenario, the SMBH accretion of hotter gas happens with a low rate in a optically-thin and geometrically-thick disk configuration, releasing energy in form of relativistic particles. The latter is typically observed in BCG.

In previous studies, it has been shown that a large fraction (about 30 per cent overall) of BCGs have signatures of AGN activity, including radio emission (Lin & Mohr 2007; von der Linden et al. 2007; Stott et al. 2012).
